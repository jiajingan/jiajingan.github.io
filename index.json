[{"content":"Back in my sophomore year I got rejected by 3 internships (or more) because my OOP skills weren\u0026rsquo;t good enough. I want to make this post to remind myself I know the concepts. Java Basic Concepts\nWhat is a class? A class is a blueprint of anything, I mean literally anything. You can also have nested class too (this is too advanced for now). For example, a car has an engine, mpg, top speed, gear type, gear amount, and etc but the class will hold all of theses. A class holds different types of fields(states) and methods(functions). What is an object? An object in Java are the attributes of differents types of function. For example, a car has an engine, mpg, top speed, gear type, gear amount, and etc but the class will hold all of theses. For example, there is a toyota camry, honda civic, and etc. You can use the class to make an object. Note: instance and object are the same thing What is interface? An interface is an blueprint of a class. It can only hold static constants and abstract methods. These type of methods are only used to define things but cannot hold values. For example, a car interface would consist types of methods like public float mpg, public int gearType = \u0026quot;\u0026quot; and etc. What is a Package? A package in java is like a library in other languages. You can import a class that has functions that can write codes more efficiently. For example, \u0026lsquo;import java.util.Scanner;\u0026rsquo;, this only imports the scanner class from util library. You can also import everything from util by \u0026lsquo;import java.util.*;\u0026rsquo; What does static mean? Static keyword means it belongs to a certain member or class type. For example, you can define a car brand like toyota in car class. They are global variables for a class. So it means you can access it without using the object compared to just declaring string make. There is static blocks, variables, methods, and classes. Pros and Cons of OOP\nPros You can build programs that are modular based and structured Very enterprise friendly like Java (Jobs!!!!) Everything is an object Low development cost I heard it\u0026rsquo;s more secure? Cons A lot of boilerplate code Desigining good OOP structure can be hard, and might shoot yourself in the foot sometimes Can be slow sometimes Code can get messy Everything is an object ","permalink":"https://jackiegan.com/posts/oop/","summary":"Back in my sophomore year I got rejected by 3 internships (or more) because my OOP skills weren\u0026rsquo;t good enough.

In this travel pt1, I want to share some of my favorite places that I have traveled before the pandemic and places I have traveled this summer.\nAtlanta, GA (ATL) I have to admit I had a great time at Atlanta with friends. There is a lot to the city, a lot of places to visit such as Atlanta Botanical Garden, World of Coca-Cola, Georgia Aquarium and so on. The Botanical Garden is HUGE!!!! Get yourself a good pair of walking shoes before you go there. The weather is relatively warm during the summer, great food (Atlanta Breakfast Club). Midtown looks very nice, it has it\u0026rsquo;s own tech hub going on with all the big corps. Georgia Tech is also there. There is a lot of see and a lot to do.\nrating: â˜…â˜…â˜…â˜…â˜†\nCharlotte, NC (CLT) Charlotte was quite the unique experience for me. It the kind of town you need to know where to go, because their center city(uptown) is pretty dead during the weekend(just a bunch of corporate offices). Places like South End, Optimist Hall and Noda was pretty interesting. However, Charlotte is a big city, there is a lot to do if you are willing to drive a bit. If you ever go to Charlotte, must try out Boardwalk Billy\u0026rsquo;s and Cookout!!. The food scene is pretty mediocre, I haven\u0026rsquo;t found anything that was spectacular. I feel like this city has a lot of hidden gems that I haven\u0026rsquo;t explored yet.\nrating: â˜…â˜…â˜…â˜†â˜†\nMelbourne, FL (MLB) I spent a good portion of my life in Melbourne FL during the summer. It\u0026rsquo;s more known as a beach town an hour outside of Orlando. I think it\u0026rsquo;s a great place to come once in a while for vacation. Beautiful ocean, quiet, hearing the ocean washing up the shore was soul soothing. The beaches is not crowded!!! Highly recommend to walk along the beach by sunset. The food scene is pretty mediocre like worse than CLT. You will find a lot of older gentlemen and ladies in the area. There is only one place I can really recommend, MisterO1.\nrating: â˜…â˜…â˜†â˜†â˜† (2.5, there is no half a star)\nSingapore (it\u0026rsquo;s a country) I went to singapore a couple years ago, I think it\u0026rsquo;s probably one of the cleanest and nicest places I have ever been to. It\u0026rsquo;s a hidden gem in Asia. Everyone talks about Korea, Japan, Thailand. I haven\u0026rsquo;t been to those places but I think Singapore is unique for itself. It\u0026rsquo;s clean, well organized, great food. Their architecture is top notch, very modern and well designed. The food scene is awesome, you can just go to some random hawker stand, you should be able to find good food. Very small and compact city. It\u0026rsquo;s just very expensive.\nrating: â˜…â˜…â˜…â˜…â˜†\n","permalink":"https://jackiegan.com/posts/travel/","summary":"In the last few years, I haven\u0026rsquo;t been traveling internationally or domestically due to the unspoken deadly disease ðŸ˜·.
